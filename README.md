# Term Deposit Prediction with Random Forest Classifier

This project predicts a customer's likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit using a Random Forest Classifier model.

**1. Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on various features. 
It uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm and can be used for:

* **Customer Segmentation:** Identify potential customers who might be interested in term deposits based on their characteristics.
* **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Focus marketing efforts on customers with a higher predicted probability of subscribing.

**2. Data Description**

The project utilizes a dataset containing customer information and their term deposit subscription status (y). 
The specific features in the dataset (X) will depend on your data, but might include:

* Demographic information (age, marital status, education)
* Financial information (employment details, loan status)
* Contact details (duration of contact, campaign number)
* Economic indicators (interest rates, employment rates)

**3. Model Training**

The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the provided historical data. Here's a general outline of the training process:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handle missing values in features.
    * Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder.
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Training:**
    * Train a Random Forest Classifier model on the training set.
3. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate model performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy.

**4. Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the use of a Random Forest Classifier for predicting term deposit subscriptions. 
By understanding the code and data considerations, you can adapt this approach to your specific data and goals.
